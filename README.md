# Ninja

Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed.
https://ninja-build.org/

**MODIFIED:** Moved Ninja to Re and split the code into a library and an executable using said library.

## Building Ninja itself
Building Ninja's Re port requires using the Re build system. Download its binaries [from its GitHub page](https://github.com/osdeverr/rebs/releases), clone this repository and run `re` to build Ninja.

Binaries are currently not available.
